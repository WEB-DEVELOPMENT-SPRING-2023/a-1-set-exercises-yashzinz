        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Sherlock Holmes is the overall title given to the series of Sherlock Holmes adaptations produced by the British television company Granada Television between 1984 and 1994. The first two series were shown under the title The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and were followed by subsequent series with the titles of other short story collections by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Of the 60 Holmes stories written by Doyle, 43 were adapted in the series, spanning 36 one-hour episodes and five feature-length specials. (Episode 40 incorporates the plot lines of both "The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone" and "The Adventure of the Three Garridebs". Episode 35 "The Eligible Bachelor" has material from both "The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor" and "The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger".)</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
        <p >In the late Victorian era, Sherlock Holmes is the world's only consulting detective. His practice is largely with private clients, but he is also known to assist the police, often in the shape of Inspector Lestrade, when their cases overlap. His clients range from private citizens of modest means to members of royalty. His ability to spot clues easily overlooked by others, bring certain specialist knowledge — for example chemistry, botany, anatomy – and deductive reasoning to bear on problems enable him to solve the most complex cases. He is assisted in his work by military veteran Dr. John Watson, with whom he shares rooms at 221B Baker Street. He craves mental stimulation, and is known to relapse into depression when there are insufficiently complex cases to engage him.</p>

        <p>"The minute you hear the hooves clopping and see the Baker Street sign, you know the case is about to begin. I love hearing the orchestral theme music play as I get glimpses of the period. I like to go all in when I watch any mystery, which means a variety of tea and little pastries. The period is romantic, with each scene displaying beautiful costumes and the perfect interior and exterior backdrops. This version of 'A Scandal In Bohemia' made me want to see more from these two actors. It will take less than fifty-two minutes for the director and actors to connect you to a classic story and its famous characters. In my opinion, as Holmes would put it when describing Irene Adler, Gale Hunnicutt is "The Woman." I have seen Batman movies where there is no Robin, but David Burke proved in this first episode that there is no Sherlock Holmes without Dr. Watson. Jeremy Brett offers the viewer a realistic version of Holmes. I could read the book now and see Brett as Holmes in each chapter. I have watched many versions of Sherlock Holmes on television and in the movies, but out of all of them, Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes is the one I always come back to every year since I was twelve. Each scene is the turn of a page while I sit back, sipping on my tea with the feeling of excitement at what happens next." <br> <p class="quote">-TalK TeaV</p><br><br></p>
        <p>"Wonderfully dare I say beautifully acted by Jeremy Brett and his balletic movements around the set or floor of which he stands or parades his talents is exquisite. The expressions in his face and the passion for which his whole body and mannerisms exude his love for his art not just as an actor but the engagement he has with the character Sherlock Holmes. David Burke as Dr Watson is like a fine cheese accompaniment to a full bodied red wine and their banter is enjoyable as a third party of which to gaze upon. The 41 episodes for the series are all set vary nicely in the period of the time and the story telling adapted delightfully for television." <br><p class="quote">-Paul Abrams</p></p><br><br>
