        <p>"The minute you hear the hooves clopping and see the Baker Street sign, you know the case is about to begin. I love hearing the orchestral theme music play as I get glimpses of the period. I like to go all in when I watch any mystery, which means a variety of tea and little pastries. The period is romantic, with each scene displaying beautiful costumes and the perfect interior and exterior backdrops. This version of 'A Scandal In Bohemia' made me want to see more from these two actors. It will take less than fifty-two minutes for the director and actors to connect you to a classic story and its famous characters. In my opinion, as Holmes would put it when describing Irene Adler, Gale Hunnicutt is "The Woman." I have seen Batman movies where there is no Robin, but David Burke proved in this first episode that there is no Sherlock Holmes without Dr. Watson. Jeremy Brett offers the viewer a realistic version of Holmes. I could read the book now and see Brett as Holmes in each chapter. I have watched many versions of Sherlock Holmes on television and in the movies, but out of all of them, Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes is the one I always come back to every year since I was twelve. Each scene is the turn of a page while I sit back, sipping on my tea with the feeling of excitement at what happens next." <br> <p class="quote">-TalK TeaV</p><br><br></p>
        <p>"Wonderfully dare I say beautifully acted by Jeremy Brett and his balletic movements around the set or floor of which he stands or parades his talents is exquisite. The expressions in his face and the passion for which his whole body and mannerisms exude his love for his art not just as an actor but the engagement he has with the character Sherlock Holmes. David Burke as Dr Watson is like a fine cheese accompaniment to a full bodied red wine and their banter is enjoyable as a third party of which to gaze upon. The 41 episodes for the series are all set vary nicely in the period of the time and the story telling adapted delightfully for television." <br><p class="quote">-Paul Abrams</p></p><br><br>
